<h2 class="mb-5">Background</h2>
<p class="lead">Tanner has been part of our family since he was 8 weeks old.  He's accustomed to a child-free home.  It has just been my wife, our pomeranian, and myself living with him.</p>

<p class="lead">He's been in good health all these years.  He's never had any health issues, and is up-to-date on vaccinations. He is missing two of his small, front teeth.</p>
