<p class="lead">He likes cuddling on the couch, sunbathing outside or in a sunspot, going for walks, and sticking his head out the window while cruising in the car.  Like most Shiba Inus, he's loyal, clean, smart, and athletic.  He comes and sits on command.  If you're in need of a "high five", he's willing to give you one.  He thrives on attention, but also likes his alone time.  He'll find a spot of his own; prefers a corner to relax by himself.</p>
